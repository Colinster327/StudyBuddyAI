    "question": "What is the optimal cache replacement algorithm and why is it optimal?",

  {
    "question": "Why can’t operating systems use MIN as the page replacement algorithm?",
    "answer": "MIN requires knowledge of future memory references, which is impossible at runtime, so OSes use approximations like LRU, LFU, FIFO, or Clock. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}",

    "question": "Why are dirty bits important in virtual memory systems?",
    "answer": "Dirty bits indicate whether a page has been modified. If set, the OS must write the page back to disk before eviction; otherwise it can be discarded without writing. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}",
