    "question": "What does the fork() system call do?",

  {
    "question": "How does the shell execute commands internally?",
    "answer": "It parses user input, forks a new process, uses exec() to run the command, and waits for it to complete.",

    "flashcard_set": "Operating Systems Midterm"

  {
    "question": "What happens to file descriptors after a fork()?",
